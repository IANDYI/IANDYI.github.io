                        Metolius has come up with a commercial “Daddy Draw”—a quickdraw usually used for toproping or for first
                        bolts with crux sequences—that puts lockers on both sides of a 7” dogbone in a smart, well-designed way.
                        The Anchor 'Draw's smart comes from the “captured-eye carabiners,” screwgates with a threading
                        eye that keeps the lockers oriented vertically—with the load along their major axis. I quickly made them
                        my go-to anchor draws for sport climbing and bolting. Meanwhile, the well-designed comes from the
                        lockers' (and draws') sleek, low-profile feel. These are not your clunky, improvised daddy
                        draws, but are instead the size of your standard draw, and at a relatively light 3.8 ounces (compared,
                        say, to the 2.9 ounces for Metolius's Inferno II draw), they're easy to rack and carry.

                        Eco Gold Loose Chalk marks an interesting new direction in chalk—pure magnesium carbonate harvested as a
                        byproduct of desalination instead of being mined. (See “The Hidden Environmental Cost of Climbing Chalk”
                        on Climbing.com for a look at the effect magnesite mining and the processing of magnesium
                        carbonate—chalk—have on surrounding areas.) Before you crush it, Eco Gold looks almost like kibble or
                        popcorn, with an interesting, dry, styrofoam-peanut feel that at first had me wondering how it would
                        feel on the hands. Once pulverized into finer chunks or powder, however, this stuff performs—it's
                        high-octane, high-test chalk, and because of its thick consistency lasted a long time on my hands, with
                        only a light application/coating. I've been testing for months now, on slippery gym volumes, crimpy
                        granite, and sharp sandstone. Across the board, I've noted killer adhesion and minimal dry-firing.
                        The stripped-down packaging—essentially a paper bag—scores high eco marks for not creating plastic
                        waste, too.

                        Long ago, fresh out of high school and short on cash, I tried to convince my mother to buy me a pair of
                        plastic double boots for a winter trip to the Canadian Rockies. “If I don't have double boots,
                        I'll get frostbite and lose my toes,” I whined. “You won't lose your toes if you don't
                        go,” she countered. Sage advice. But if you do end up going, consider trying the new Asolo Manaslu 8000
                        GV, a lightweight (44 ounces per boot, men's size 9) and solidly built double boot designed for the
                        extreme cold and for high-altitude expedition climbing.
